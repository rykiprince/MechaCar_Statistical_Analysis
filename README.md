Performing statistical analysis for AutoRUs' newest prototype dataset.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![summary_output]
- From above summary output, `Pr(>|t|)`, vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely to generate random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. That is to say, vehicle length and ground clearance have a significant impact on a vehicle's mpg.
- Looking at the coefficients of the model, the slope of the linear model is **NOT** considered to be zero. 
- While we look at the value of r^2, it represents that this model is 70% correlatively predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes, which is strong effect size. Also, the p-value is statistically significant.
